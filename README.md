Hello,

I have completed three tasks in the exam. Them being data manipulation and visualisation (the one with my max interest), creating a LangChain that uses openai's gpt 3.5 turbo model and a discord bot that Greets people with Hello '$username'to every new message incoming.

I am attaching an image which is the output of 1st task here for your reference and for other two tasks my quota was exceeded so won't be able to provide screenshot for them but you will be able to see the logic/code.
